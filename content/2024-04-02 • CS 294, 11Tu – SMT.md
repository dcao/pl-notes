- SAT
	- Given a Boolean formula can we replace variables with T/F such that formula evals to T?
	- SAT if yes, UNSAT if no
	- *valid* if yes $\forall$ inputs (i.e., $F$ is valid iff $\neg F$ is UNSAT)
- SMT
	- SAT *modulo theories*
	- Theories: what kinds of thins we can write down and combine w first-order logic to be able to give to SAT solver
	- first-order logic: connectives, parens, no quantifiers, constants, n-ary functions and predicates, no variables
		- $x$ used in one place is the same as another place. No reassignment.
	- Universe: non-empty set of values
	- Interpretation:
		- maps symbol to element of universe
		- maps function symbol to function from tuple of universe elems to universe elem
		- maps predicate symbol to true/false
- Theories
	- Equality with uninterpreted functions
		- $=$ is interpreted, nothing else is
		- Axioms: have some equality axioms
	- Fixed-width bitvectors
	- LIA
