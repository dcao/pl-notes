# About this website

Welcome to [David's](https://cao.sh) PL Prelim Notes! This website contains a bunch of notes on topics on programming language (PL) implementation and theory. This site might be useful for you for a few reasons:

- You're currently studying for the [UC Berkeley PL Prelim](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HbkKsJ1iJSXSGZ9C_gIlVJbiDjiuDUQDp1YT-QalStM/edit), and you're looking for topics to study, resources for those topics, and general notes on the relevant topics.
- You're interested in PL generally, and are looking for readings & notes on a survey of different PL-related topics.

In either case, this site has a bunch of resources that might be helpful for you! Specifically, we have:

- A **syllabus** (see below) of different topics and readings that cover a broad range of PL topics.
- **Reading notes** on individual readings with respect to these topics.
- **Topic notes** that synthesize multiple (some of the reading notes do this as well)
- **Study guides** that summarize 

I originally wrote these notes in preparation for the Berkeley PL Prelim, so they're provided *as-is*; I basically haven't changed them since I copy-pasted them here, so a lot of them might make reference to Prelim-related things.

If you have any questions, feel free to email me (it's on my website linked above).

> [!warning] Formatting caveats
> As a consequence of me manually copy-pasting my notes to this site, there might be missing pages; this is unintentional, and you should let me know if you run into this!
>
> Additionally, type judgments/derivations will look weird---they're missing the horizontal line dividing consequence and consequent, because of LaTeX rendering weirdness with the static site generator I'm using. They'll look like this:
> $$
> \begin{prooftree} \AXC{$\Gamma(x) = T$} \UIC{$\Gamma \vdash x : T$} \end{prooftree}
> $$
>
> Apologies in advance :^)


## Extra Prelim-related notes

From the syllabus:

> Keep in mind that some topics---for example language design and implementation---are rather broad. It is expected that students can answer reasonable open-ended questions that go beyond the content of papers listed below.

...and something else somebody told me at some point:

> Since this prelim is about understanding of topics, checking off the readings probably won't be sufficient. Completion is finished when you understand the topic, and you should definitely add additional readings to the topics where needed.

### Optional

- [ ] % Girard, LaFont, and Taylor‚Äôs [Proofs and Types](http://www.paultaylor.eu/stable/Proofs+Types.html) chapters 2-7 are a remarkably compact presentation of the basic proof theory that makes types work.
- [ ] % Frank Pfenning‚Äôs [Computation and Deduction](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~twelf/notes/cd.ps) covers similar ground, but in much greater detail. His [webpage](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fp/) has a number of exceptionally readable papers on computational logic.
- [ ] % The explanation of denotational semantics in John C. Mitchell‚Äôs [Foundations for Programming Languages](http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&tid=3460) is extremely clear and comprehensible.¬† If you find Winskel to be frustrating, try this.
