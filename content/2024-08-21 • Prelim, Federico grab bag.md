Length: **30 min**.

Let's say we're in a simple imperative language with arithmetic and conditional expressions (think IMP!). Specifically, we have numbers, arithmetic expressions, and variables.

- Write the operational semantics for the $\leq$ operation.
- Now, write the operational semantics for chained comparison, Ã  la Python: $x \leq y \leq z$.
	- How could we preserve short-circuiting semantics with this?
- Let's say our language also has side effecting functions.
	- Does your semantics have potentially surprising interactions with side effects? Why or why not?
